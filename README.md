**DISCLAIMER:** This darktable version is most probably NOT ready for production. With the time, when we(among all) polish the build, it could be.

# homebrew-darktable

This is a 3rd party tap for [Darktable](http://darktable.org/). It provides a formula for darktable which includes Lua support.

* [Installation and usage](#how-do-i-install-these-formulae)
* [Updating](#updating)
* [Issues](#issues)


## How do I install these formulae?

`brew install rgo/homebrew-darktable/darktable`

Or `brew tap rgo/homebrew-darktable` and then `brew install darktable`.


### I want to try new devevelopments/features from master branch

First of all, unlink your current darktable version installed: `brew unlink darktable`

Now, you're ready to install latest master version `brew install darktable --HEAD`


#### I'm really brave and I want to try features from other developers!

You can change head to point to a different repository simply editing the formula.
All you need is to execute `brew edit darktable`

It will open the formula, and just before the `depends_on` section you will find `head`.
Then, you only have to replace it with the repository and branch you want to try.

Example:

```
  # head "https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable.git" # ORIGINAL LINE COMMENTED
  head "https://github.com/foobar/darktable.git", :branch => "cool_feature_to_test"
```
_NOTE:_ I prefer comment original line than delete it.

Save your changes and `brew install darktable --HEAD`

If you already have darktable head installed then you have to do a `brew reinstall darktable`


*WARNING:* To avoid database incompatibilities when you're testing a HEAD version [execute darktable database in memory](#i-already-have-it-installed-but-i-want-to-to-test-it) (read below).


## I want to run darktable

After installing darktable you can open it by executing `darktable` from your terminal.

It's up to you to create a direct access or something similar.


### I already have darktable installed, I ONLY want to to test it

To avoid break anyhting of your current installation, you can execute this darktable with the database in memory, custom cache directory and a separate configuration path:

```
darktable --library :memory: --cachedir /tmp/homebrew-darktable-head-cache/ --configdir ~/.config/homebrew-darktable-head
```


## Updating

### Darktable

To upgrade darktable you should execute `brew upgrade darktable`

It takes into account if you are using master or stable version and only updates that version.


### Formula

To upgrade the formula to the most recent stable release, as usual: `brew update`
