**DISCLAIMER:** This darktable version is most probably NOT ready for production. With the time, when we(among all) polish the build, it could be.

## How do I install these formulae?

`brew install rgo/homebrew-darktable/darktable`

Or `brew tap rgo/homebrew-darktable` and then `brew install darktable`.


### I'm brave and I want to try new devevelopments/features!

First of all, unlink your current darktable version installed: `brew unlink darktable`

Now, you're ready to install latest master version `brew install darktable --HEAD`

*WARNING:* To avoid database incompatibilities when you're testing a HEAD version execute darktable database in memory (read below).


## I want to run darktable

After installing darktable you can open it by executing `darktable` from your terminal.

It's up to you to create a direct access or something similar.


### I already have darktable installed, I ONLY want to to test it

To avoid break anyhting of your current installation, you can execute this darktable with the database in memory, custom cache directory and a separate configuration path:

```
darktable --library :memory: --cachedir /tmp/homebrew-darktable-head-cache/ --configdir ~/.config/homebrew-darktable-head
```


## Updating

To upgrade the formula to the most recent stable release:

```
brew update && brew upgrade homebrew-darktable/darktable/darktable
```
